      Why We Built the Most Honest Corporate Website on the Internet
    </p>

    <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert mx-auto text-left">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Life at CorpX isn’t fiction.
        It’s reality — just slightly stripped of its press releases and polished LinkedIn posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built Life at CorpX because it’s what countless developers, engineers, designers, and employees experience every single day:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Endless roadmaps that collapse the second a client escalates.</li>
        <li>Corporate “values” that exist only in onboarding slides.</li>
        <li>Leadership calendars full of status meetings but empty of decisions.</li>
        <li>Cultures that celebrate "resilience" because it’s cheaper than fixing the system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Life at CorpX isn’t an exaggeration. It’s a documentary — just with better punchlines.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The modern tech industry has trained an entire generation to think:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disorganization is innovation.</li>
        <li>Leadership theater is vision.</li>
        <li>Customer fear is strategy.</li>
        <li>Career survival is success.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It’s normalized the idea that short-term wins are all that matter — even if they burn out every builder in the system.
        Life at CorpX exists to remind people:
        <strong>You’re not crazy. You’re not lazy. The system is broken.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>What CorpX Represents</h2>
      <p>
        CorpX is every company that drifted from intention to survival theater.
        Every "career development plan" that meant "you’re stuck."
        Every manager rewarded for visibility instead of impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        CorpX is the real employer of the modern knowledge worker.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Hope It Does</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Give people permission to laugh</strong> — to see the chaos around them isn’t their fault.</li>
        <li><strong>Start better conversations</strong> — about sustainable, humane, meaningful work.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Because if we can’t name the sickness, we can never heal it.
      </p>

      <h2>In Closing</h2>
      <p>
        Life at CorpX isn’t satire. It’s a mirror.
        We hope you find some humor, some catharsis — and maybe some resolve — while you’re here.
